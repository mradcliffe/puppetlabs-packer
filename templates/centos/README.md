# puppetlabs-packer

### About

This contains all of the var files required to build any of the templates in the `templates/common` directory for Centos platforms.

### Support Status

This repository includes OS platforms that are officially supported at Puppet and ones that are entirely maintained by the community. Packer templates include a `support_status` variable which indicates whether the template is puppet maintained vs. community maintained.

Puppet maintained CentOS versions include 5.11, 6.8, 7.2 and 8.0. Any other versions of CentOS here are community maintained.

### Building

All templates must be built in the `<os_dist>/<variant>/<arch>` directory. Make sure that the environment variable PACKER\_VM\_OUT\_DIR is set so that Packer knows where to copy the build artifacts (it is common to set it to ".", the current `<os_dist>/<variant>/<arch>` directory). If you are building a template with a vmware-vmx builder, be sure to set the PACKER\_VM\_SRC\_DIR environment variable to the directory containing the directory containing the relevant vm files. It is common to set PACKER\_VM\_SRC\_DIR = PACKER\_VM\_OUT\_DIR to make it easy to build a vmware-vmx template from a previous vmware build.

## Centos 5.11/6.8

The boot command for Centos < 7 is slightly different, so we have an additional var file to include in the build process.

To build any template in the `templates/common` directory for Centos 5.11/6.8, type:
```
packer build -var-file=../../common/vars.json -var-file=../common/vars.json -var-file=vars.json ../../../common/<template-file>
```

For example, if you want to build the vmware.vsphere.nocm template, type
```
packer build -var-file=../../common/vars.json -var-file=../common/vars.json -var-file=vars.json ../../../common/vmware.vsphere.nocm
```

## Centos 7.0/7.2
To build any template in the `templates/common` directory for Centos 7.0/7.2, type:
```
packer build -var-file=../../common/vars.json -var-file=vars.json ../../../common/<template-file>
```

For example, if you want to build the vmware.vsphere.nocm template, type
```
packer build -var-file=../../common/vars.json -var-file=vars.json ../../../common/vmware.vsphere.nocm
```
